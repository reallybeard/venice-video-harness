// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Self-describing pipeline.
//
// `venice-video --help` is a flat list of 40+ commands with no ordering. An
// agent that has not read AGENTS.md cannot tell that `generate-videos` comes
// after a QA gate, or that two steps are gated on an explicit approval. That
// missing order is the single largest cause of poor output.
//
// This is the pipeline stated as data: the ordered stages, the artifact each
// produces, the gate (if any) that must clear first, and the literal command
// that advances it. `venice-video pipeline [--json]` prints it, so the order
// travels inside the binary and cannot be left out of a published tarball.
//
// `classifyEpisode` / `classifyProject` (`session/status.ts`) walk this table:
// their stage ids are ids here and their commands are these commands in shell
// form, so renaming or reordering a stage changes `status` too, and
// `tests/core-stages.test.mjs` fails if the two stop covering each other.
// When a gate condition changes in `cli.ts`, change the classifier and the
// stage here in the same commit — a stale map is worse than none.
