 *
 *   - 'native'      — the video model speaks the dialogue in-frame. Seedance
 *                     and HappyHorse use character voice-donor references when
 *                     available to preserve timbre, accent, and pacing. Best when
 *                     characters speak only once or twice, the model's voice
 *                     range suffices, and you don't need precise control.
 *                     `assemble-episode` keeps `dialogueReplace: false`.
 *   - 'lip-sync'    — exact lip-sync mode: Venice TTS renders each dialogue
 *                     line and the video model receives it as `audio_url`, so
 *                     the character's mouth follows that exact recording.
 *                     Best when a character speaks many times (so a single
 *                     voice picks up across the episode), the user wants
 *                     accent control, or the dialogue needs deterministic
 *                     delivery. The planner routes face-visible low/medium-
 *                     motion dialogue shots to `videoDefaults.lipSyncModel`.
 *                     `assemble-episode` defaults `dialogueReplace: true`.
 *   - 'narrator-vo' — the speaker is a NARRATOR / voice-over only (no on-camera
 *                     speaking mouth). Every dialogue-bearing shot is queued
 *                     with `audio: false` so Seedance can't synthesize a
 *                     competing narrator; Venice TTS owns the dialogue lane.
 *                     `assemble-episode` defaults `dialogueReplace: true` and
 *                     `nativeVolume: 0`. Sets `audioMix.suppressModelNarration: true`.

 * explicit exact-audio lip-sync strategy; it does not affect native dialogue.
 *
 * Family quick reference:
 *   - 'seedance'     — Seedance 2.5 (default). Strong R2V identity anchoring,
 *                      every integer 4-30s in a single pass, up to 30 reference
 *                      images, 480p/720p, native `audio: true` + reference audio.
 *                      Rides the montage-first lane. (2.0 R2V Enhanced, the
 *                      prior default, is 1080p-capable and still selectable via
 *                      a videoDefaults override.)
 *   - 'happyhorse'   — HappyHorse 1.1 (Alibaba, #1 blind-preference T2V + I2V).
 *                      Joint single-pass video+audio, phoneme-level lip-sync in
 *                      7 languages, and R2V with up to 9 reference images. 3-15s
 *                      natives, 720p/1080p. Best for talking characters and
 *                      multilingual localization; SFW/commercial-leaning (for
 *                      mature work prefer Seedance 2.0 or Wan 2.7). The 1.0 IDs
 *                      remain in the registry for back-compat.
 *   - 'minimax-h3'   — MiniMax H3, the open-weight omni-modal model. Renders
 *                      2K with native stereo audio for roughly a third of what
 *                      other families cost per second, and its R2V lane takes
 *                      the same 9-image reference stack as Seedance. Two hard
 *                      constraints: 2K is the only resolution (no draft tier,
 *                      so every take is a finish-quality spend) and the
 *                      duration ladder starts at 5s, so 3-4s beats have to be
 *                      re-scripted or routed elsewhere.
 *   - 'minimax-h3-max' / 'minimax-h3-max-turbo'
 *                    — MiniMax H3 Max. Despite the name, NOT a bigger H3: it
 *                      renders 768P (not 2K), it is `private` rather than
 *                      anonymized, and it wants a plain prompt instead of the
 *                      directorial stack (`promptStyle: 'simple'`). The model
 *                      composes its own coverage and cutting from a stated
 *                      intent, which makes it the montage / "let the model tell
 *                      the beat" family — and at $0.024/s (Turbo $0.012/s,
 *                      the cheapest lane here) a 15s take is disposable enough
 *                      to generate several and pick. Duration ladder is 5-15s
 *                      like H3. Turbo has no R2V lane, so both families anchor
 *                      identity on `minimax-h3-max-reference-to-video`.
 *   - 'wan-3-0'      — Wan 3.0. The only family that renders past 15s: the
 *                      ladder runs 5/10/15/20/25/30s at 480p/720p/1080p with
 *                      native audio always on. Its R2V lane takes the same
 *                      9-image reference stack as Seedance. It accepts no
 *                      audio input at all, so exact lip-sync shots fall back
 *                      to Wan 2.7.
 *   - 'grok-imagine' — Grok Imagine i2v + R2V (R2V durations stepped at
 *                      5s/8s/10s only). Pick for atmosphere-rich shots or
 *                      when the user wants Grok's signature look.
 *   - 'kling-o3'     — Kling O3 Standard / Pro / 4K. Best for stylized /
 *                      illustrated aesthetics. Accepts non-seedream images.
