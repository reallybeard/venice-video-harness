// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Stream engine -- an infinite, live-authored story.
//
// This is NOT the loop. The loop takes a fixed plan and re-renders the same N
// shots forever so the playback cycles. The stream never repeats a shot and
// never renders a shot twice. It writes the story forward, one beat at a time:
//
//   beat 1  -> the intelligence model writes it from the series bible
//           -> renders t2v (the only render with no start frame)
//   beat 2  -> the model writes it from the bible + what has happened so far
//           -> renders i2v off beat 1's LAST frame
//   beat 3  -> i2v off beat 2's last frame
//   ...     -> forever, until stopped or the budget is reached
//
// The story is infinite; the playback is linear. A viewer starts at beat 1
// and plays forward. Every beat stays on disk in order (no ring buffer). There
// is no re-anchoring: each frame descends from the frame before it, so the
// picture evolves the way a very long single take would.
//
// Output lives under `episodes/episode-NNN/stream/`: `beat-NNNNN.mp4`,
// `beat-NNNNN.json` (the authored beat), `story-so-far.md` (the rolling memory
// the writer reads and appends to), and `stream-manifest.json`. Canonical
// `scene-001/` renders and series.json are never touched.
